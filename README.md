# German-Rental-Property-Analysis

Objective:

Perform exploratory analysis on German rental property specs to determine how prices are comprised.

Data:

Data:  Data was scraped from Immoscout, the biggest real-state platform in Germany. While Immoscout contains details on both properties for rent and for sale, this data set only contains only rental properties. 
This German rental property data is open-source and was downloaded through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany). Germany State Geo JSON file was downloaded [here](https://iw.mapandroute.de/MapAPI-1.3/docs/showcase/display-geojson-data/polygons/index.html).

Tools:

Python, Tableau

[Tableau Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/GermanRentalPropertyAnalysis/GermanRentalPropertyAnalysis?:language=en-US&:retry=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) - This storyboard does not contain all of the analysis performed to complete this project - only those relavant to the final analysis.
